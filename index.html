        <p class="quote">The Moon, in all her glory, was not immune to the Sculptor. Every full moon her immortal light would fall on New Orleans and the crickets and fireflies would dance in the spotlight. 
         But just as the Moon has dictated the turn of tides for millennia, the Sculptor began to dictate the Moon’s influence on the Earth. 
         The Moon’s light cast a spotlight onto people whose hearts were already starting to become twisted by the Sculptor. Mother caused harm to child, brother betrayed brother, and others let their minds wander into madness and desperation. 
         Those who knew the power of both the Sculptor and the Moon began to plot and use the twisting of people’s hearts to their advantage.
